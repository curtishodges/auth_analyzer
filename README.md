Just a simple python script that takes a csv file and then does some analysing of data. 

Threw togather as part of a daily coding challenge after a starting to learn Python.

Example usage: python3 auth_analyzer.py <path_to_log_file>

csv format:
ts	user	ip	result
2025-08-10T09:00:00	alice	10.0.0.1	FAIL
2025-08-10T09:01:00	alice	10.0.0.1	FAIL

Example output:
